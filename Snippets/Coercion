Abstract Value Operations-These operations are done on all coercions
  Value-> String is done with the abstract toString() operation
    JSON
      toJSON() is not coercion, but acts similarly
  Value-> Number is done with toNumber()
    true=1
    false=0
    When dealing with objects Number() will check if there is
      a valueOf() or toString() functions inside of the object
  Value-> Boolean is done with  toBoolean()
    Anything that isn't false is true: undefined, null, false,0, NaN, ""
    All JS objects are=truth, except some objects provided by the browser
    , but generally all objects = truth

Explicit Coercion
  Number <-> Strings
    Number-> String
      String(num)
      num.toString()//implicitly wraps num, and then uses toString()
    String-> Number
      Number(str)
      +str
  Parsing Numeric Strings
    parseInt() takes a string and makes it to a Number, however if non-number
      value is encountered, then it stops looking for numbers to the right.
    Coercion on the other hand will give NaN when trying to coerce a non-coerceable
      value
  Any value->Boolean
    Boolean()
    ! or !! or !!! or ...

Implicit Coercion
  String<-> Numbers
    value + value
      If either value is String or (valueOf() or toString) produces a string:
        Then we concatenate as a string, numeric addition otherwise
    '' + int = string
    str - 0 = int
    obj + obj => str + str=>int + int
  Booleans-> Numbers
    +boolean => Number
  Value-> Boolean
    Values are coerced when comparing values
    || and &&
      First, the values are coerced into boolean values and then one of the values
        are used.
        Ex: var a = 'Hello' || null;//a = 'Hello'
            var b = 'Hello' && null;//a = null
    ..Left off at symbol coercion

Loose Equals vs. Strict Equals
  == allows coercion
  === disallows coercion

Abstract Equality '=='
  If two values are of same type then they are compared via identity.
    Ex. 42 only equals 42
  When comparing two objects, then they are equal only when they are references
    to the same value.
  When comparing different types, then 1 or both values will be implicitly coerced
    to same type.

  Comparing String to Number
    42 == '42'
      String is coerced into a number
  Comparing anything to Boolean
    '42' == true//false
      Boolean value is first made into number
        '42' == 1
      Now String is made into number
        42 == 1//false
  Comparing null to undefined
    null == undefined//Always true
  Comparing Objects to Non-Objects
    42 == [42]//true
      Object is made toPrimitive()//Abstract value Operations
      42 == 42//true
    Object('abc') == 'abc'//true
    'abc' == 'abc'

Safely using Implicit coercion
  If either side of the comparison can have true or false values, don't ever,
    EVER use ==.
    If either side of the comparison can have [], "", or 0 values, seriously
      consider not using ==.
    In these scenarios, it's almost certainly better to use === instead of ==,
      to avoid unwanted coercion.
    Follow those two simple rules and pretty much all the coercion gotchas that
      could reasonably hurt you will effectively be avoided.
Being more explicit/verbose in these cases will save you from a lot of headaches.

Abstract Relational Comparison (a < b)
  1. ToPrimitive tries to make a, b into String
  2. If there is no string, then use toNumber to compare a, b numerically
