Natives refers to object wrappers for primitives
  Ex. var a = new String('abc');
      a//Object Wrapper for 'abc'

Browsers are optimized to box primitives to perform operations on them.
Generally it is not a good idea to use natives.

  Boxing primitives is usually frowned upon.

  Getting boxed primitive values is done with valueOf()
